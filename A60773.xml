         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>SOME CONSIDERATIONS <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>umbly offered to the Honourable the Houſe of COMMONS, by the Governour and Company of Merchants of <hi>England,</hi> Trading into the <hi>Levant Seas,</hi> touching the Bill, <hi>Intitled, A Bill for the further incouragement of the Woollen Manufactures of this Kingdom.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. THat the Conſumption of <hi>Broad Clothes</hi> in <hi>Turky</hi> hath been of late years in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, from 14 or 15 Thouſand, to 25 or 30 Thouſand <hi>Clothes per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi> and that this increaſe hath been cheifly effected by taking Raw-Silk and Mohair-Yarn in exchange for them: And if the conſumption of Silk and Yarn be leſned in <hi>England,</hi> the conſumption of <hi>Engliſh Cloth</hi> will be proportionably leſned in <hi>Turky;</hi> for that <hi>Turky</hi> doth not afford Commodities proper for <hi>England</hi> to be brought in returns, to a fourth part of the value of the <hi>Cloth</hi> ſent thither, other then the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Commodities of Raw Silk, and Mohair-Yarn, of which two Commodities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three fourth parts of the value is in Silk, and one fourth part in Mohair-Yarn.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That if we do not exchange our coarſe <hi>Clothes</hi> for Silk and Mohair-Yarn, the Dutch will thereby have an opportunity (which they will certainly make uſe of, not only to introduce a Manufacture of coarſe <hi>Cloth</hi> of their own; but alſo extreamly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe ours; and in a great meaſure gain the Manufacturing of Silk and Yarn, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>England</hi> there-with.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That it may be feared, the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> taking notice of any reſtraint of the expence of his Native Commodities in <hi>England,</hi> may by way of Retaliation, prohibit the uſe of our <hi>Cloth</hi> in <hi>Turky,</hi> which would be of very great dammage to this Nation, <hi>Turky</hi> being now the place of its greateſt Conſumption: And if coarſe <hi>Clothes</hi> be not vended there, the <hi>Clothiers</hi> muſt decline the making them, and conſequently coarſe Wooll lye on hand, and be of little uſe or value.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That many Thouſands of Families in this Kingdom do wholly ſubſiſt upon the Manufacturing of Silk and Mohair-yarn, who will be thereby thrown out of their Livelyhoods, and conſtrained to remove themſelves into other Countries, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly into <hi>France,</hi> whether they are already invited by Promiſes of great Rewards. Whereas the Manufacturing of Silk and Mohair-yarn in <hi>England,</hi> doth daily bring over great numbers of Manufacturers from Foreign parts (who are generally Proteſtants) to the great benefit of the Kingdom both in People and Wealth.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That the forbidding the wearing Silks in the Winter Seaſon, doth in a great meaſure exclude the Manufacturing of Silk in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks being thick and ſubſtantial are fitteſt for the Winter Seaſon: Whereas the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and ſlighter Silks that are worn in the Summer time, are brought in fully Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and other Foreign Parts.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That if this Bill ſhall paſſe into a Law, the Conſumption of <hi>Spaniſh Wool,</hi> may be augmented; but in no proportion to recompence the loſs which the <hi>Engliſh Wool</hi> will ſuſtain thereby; becauſe the Wearers of Silks and Chamblets being generally perſons of better Quality, will probably only wear Garments made of <hi>Spaniſh Cloth:</hi>
